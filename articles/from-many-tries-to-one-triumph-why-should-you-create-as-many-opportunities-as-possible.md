# From many tries to one triumph - why should you create as many opportunities as possible?

Most of us fear failure. In business and life we typically avoid risks and plan to "not lose". But here is the paradox - most of our efforts will produce average results (or even fail) - and that is perfectly fine. Why? Because often one great decision, project or encounter can outweight many failed attempts.

## "Big win" principle in action

Imagine an investor who buy shares in many companies over time. Most make a little profit, some lose money. But one stock **can grow a lot** â€” and that one win makes the biggest difference to the whole portfolio. As software engineers, we can apply the same principle. Much of our work may be small bug fixes or documentation updates - simply nothing glamorous. But one day, we might **spot an opportunity** to deliver truly significant value to a project. That single contribution can change the direction of product, improve it significantly, open new opportunities or even accelerate our own career. Business and life works the same way. Other examples can be:

ðŸŸ  **One innovative product feature** can attract thousands of new users, while many minor improvements made little difference.

ðŸŸ  **One well-organized marketing campaign** can bring better results ten earlier ones.

ðŸŸ  **One strategic partnership** can open a market you have tried to enter for years. 

ðŸŸ  **One honest, deep conversation** can repair a relationship more than years of polite small talk.

ðŸŸ  **One viral social media post** can achieve greater reach than hundreds of standard posts.

## How to apply this in your life or business in the most efficient way?

ðŸŸ¢ **Try many things** - Every attempt is a lottery ticket. Most of them won't hit the jackpot, but a few will. Don't bet everything on one idea - spread your efforts so that one big win can balance out the rest.

ðŸŸ¢ **Stay in the game** - Stay consistent. Success is often a matter of time and persistence. You only truly lose when you quit. 

ðŸŸ¢ **Spot the leverage points** - Look for opportunities where a small, well-placed effort can create outsized results. These moments are rare - try to recognize and act on them when they appear.

## Core lesson?

Get rid of the fear of failure that limits you. It's not about **avoiding failure** - it is about creating **enough opportunities** for a big win to happen. When it comes, it can change everything, no matter how many losses came before.
