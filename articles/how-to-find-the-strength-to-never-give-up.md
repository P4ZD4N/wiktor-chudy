![Blog image](/ro/ro-strength-give-up.png)

Each of us has some goals. It doesn’t matter if goal is short term, long term, easy, difficult or challenging. We all encounter the same difficulty at some stage of achieving it. I can bet that you have had at least once situation, where you started doing something and after some time, for some reason, you considered giving up or postpone the achievement of the goal to other date. How to have the strength to not give up in such moments? I want to share my ways with you!

## Remind yourself about the path you have taken to get to where you are now

I remember moment, when on the beginning of summer 2024 I decided to run 18 kilometers. Maybe it doesn’t seem like a very difficult task. Perspective changes when I tell you that I have never run such distances before. My daily routine then was 6-8 kilometers. You should also remember about temperature, which in Poland is highest exactly on the beginning of summer. In the first kilometers I felt fine, just like during normal running. Situation changed after 12 kilometers. I felt each one more and more strongly. Level of exhaustion was slowly becoming enourmous. Between kilometers 15 and 16 I had no water left. There were no shops until the finish line. Apart from that, level of exhaustion was probably the biggest in my life, my feet hurt and it was really stuffy due to the temperature. I thought I wouldn’t be able to finish this run, but I still remembered how much I had already run. Knowing this allowed me to finally complete the run despite many impediments. In moments of doubt think about all things, which you already done to be at this point. Remind yourself about failures, challanges and difficult tasks, which you can now look at as passed. Why would you give up now when you’ve already overcome so much obstackles? You will give yourself strength to continue working.

## Remember your every achievement 

They will help you in future. Keep in your mind information about how you planned to achieve each of them, what obstacles you encountered during the ways and how you overcame them. These achievements will remind you, that if you want, you can do anything. When you set new goals and in achieving them you encounter pain and doubt, reach for your achievements that will give you energy and remind you how resilient you are.
