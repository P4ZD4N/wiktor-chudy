# How to unlock everything in a negotiation with use of mirroring technique?

![Blog image](/ro-biznes/blog-ro-biznes-mirroring-technique.png)

Today I would like to describe really simple tool related to **effective communication** - mirroring technique, which can be used from daily conversations to impact negotation.

## What is Mirroring technique?

It relies on repeating **three last or most important words** used by person you are talking to. It should be done in a calm, questioning tone which suggest that you are curious and desire to understand.

## How to do it?

1️⃣ Instead of planning your response just focus on interlocutor’s words.

2️⃣ Use calm and questioning tone to repeat 1-3 most meaningful words (like asking for explanation).

3️⃣ Give your interlocutor time to reflection and area to fulfill it with additional information.

## Example

##### Speaker

We have to finish this project by the end of the week, but we are a bit short on resources.

##### You

Short on resources?

## Why it work?

When you repeat most important words you build a bond with that person and show empathy. Your interlocutor feel heard and safe, what encourages him to introduce his thoughts in more detailed form. It also forces to rephrase the statement - often can lead to **reveal key information**, **hidden problems** or just **live up conversation**.

Mastering this technique allows you to gain time to think about your strategy and most importantly, increase chances to encourage interlocutor to independently present information that you want.
