# Never resign from 1% growth!

![Blog image](/ro/ro-never-resign-1-grow.png)

Did you ever resigned when you had this great opportunity to 1% growth? If yes, this article is for you (but if not I also recommend to read to take care of your future habits). You probably had many excuses and reasons to leave it to later and do it when you will have more time. You repeated in your head, that appropriate moment to growth is only then, when you have a lot of free time or you are completely free from any duties. **Itâ€™s mistake!**

## Why small steps matter?

Striving for your success doesnâ€™t have to be based only on huge and revolutionary steps. Remember â€“ if you donâ€™t have a lot of free time, It is absolutely enough to improve yourself by 1% every day. In long time perspective these small steps would have really great impact and lead you to success. Think about it â€“ small steps seems to be not impactful, but when you improve yourself every day **(consistently and without cheating)**, these improvements add up over a long period of time. Finally you will realise, that your change is more powerful than you expected.

This is a time to show you all of this in numbers! I will use calculation, which I encountered while reading **Atomic Habits** (James Clear book).

ðŸŸ¢ **You are 1% worse every day for a year** | 0.99^365 = 0.03

ðŸŸ¢ **You are 1% better every day for a year** | 1.01^365 = 37.78

This simple calculation show us, how small steps can bring us further or closer to success. When you are 1% worse every day for a year, you will go down to almost 0. But when you are 1% better every day for a year, you are almost 38 times better, than in point when you started. Now imagine your progress in perspective over 2, 5 or 10 years. I think, that at this point we will all agree, that small steps produces amazing results!

## At the end remember

ðŸŸ¢ When you donâ€™t have a lot of free time, but you have enough to do something, use it to take a small step.

ðŸŸ¢ Be patient and consistent â€“ your small steps seems to be not impactful, but you will notice this impact in future.

ðŸŸ¢ Review your achievements and progress from time to time (not too often). After some time it will prove to you, that small steps can become reason to proud rapidly.
