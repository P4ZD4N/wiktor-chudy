# Remember that failures are the key to your success!

![Blog image](/ro/ro-failures-key.png)

## Every personâ€™s life comes with failures. 

We can divide people into two groups:

ðŸŸ¢ Those, who **avoid failures** and see them like something terrible, which happened in their lifes. People from this group believe, that failure is a good reason to become discouraged or even give up on their goals â€“ they donâ€™t learn from it.

ðŸŸ¢ Those, who **donâ€™t avoid failures** and treat them as valuable lessons, from which they can learn a lot and try again in some time â€“ with much better preparation and greater strength. People with this mindset understand, that failure is not a reflection of their worth, but an opportunity to grow. They achieve their goals more often.

Learning to accept failure and use it to increase your chance of success on your next attempt is very important. Personally, I was also in that first group â€“ I treated each failure as great reason to give up. One small stumble was enough to see no point in continuing my journey. Fortunately, I realized in time that I should move to the second group! This also applies to you if you are still afraid of making mistakes and avoiding failures! But how to change the group and create the habit of learning from failures? 

## Follow these steps next time and repeat:

### 1. Think about your failure deeply. 

Make a list of things, that werenâ€™t going well for you and that you couldnâ€™t cope with in your head (or better yet, on paper).

### 2. Then think about what have you gain from this failure 

What benefits it has given you? What things have you learnt? Has it changed your approach to something? Or maybe something else?

### 3. On the end make a list 

List of things, which you would like to remember and of things, which you can do better next time â€“ be honest with yourself!

### 4. Plan a new attempt 

Attempt to achieve the given goal at the earliest possible date.
