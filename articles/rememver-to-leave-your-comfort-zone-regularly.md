# Remember to leave your comfort zone regularly!

![Blog image](/ro/ro-leave-comfort-zone.png)

**Do you know the feeling, when you have to do some tasks and you delay them as much as possible?** And when you deliberately run away from your duties? Do you often watch TikTok or do other activities, which only make your time more enjoyable, stroke your head and which add absolutely nothing to your life? Stop immediately!

## Often we don’t even realize how much time we waste on time-wasters! 

Instead of actually doing what we need to do we waste time on time-wasters. I used to waste a lot of time myself – I avoided work, study, training or even washing dishes. At this time, I preferred play games or just lie in my comfortable bed to watch another YouTube videos or TikTok reels, that added nothing to my life. Don’t make the same mistake – time is one of the most valuable resources, which we have. Time is something, which we cannot withdraw or buy. You need to develop a resilient mind before it’s too late. To achieve this, you need to leave your comfort zone regularly.

## How to begin? 

Firstly, think about all activities, which make you feel uncomfortable and which you don’t like doing. Particularly important are those, that you are sure, that doing them is beneficial for you. As soon as possible do one of them and then do it again. The more often you feel discomfort, the more resistant you will become. Let’s begin with seemingly simple things – making your bed, ironing clothes or washing dishes. Once it stops causing you discomfort, make a next step and take more difficult tasks. At some point you will become so resilient, that not only will you have no problem doing your job, but also you will probably start be able to do things, that most people don’t do and that you yourself would have previously considered impossible.
