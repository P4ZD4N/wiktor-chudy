# Three questions that made my dialogue more meaningful

![Blog image](/ro/ro-three-questions-dialogue.png)

Centuries ago Socrates offered guideline for speech know as **Triple Filter test**. It is about asking ourselves three questions before sharing information.

## 1. Is it true?

We should firstly consider whether what we would like to say is based on facts rather than assumptions, rumors or guesses.

## 2. Is it good?

Even if something is true does it bring value, kind or positivity to others? Words can either heal or harm and this filter reminds us to choose wisely.

## 3. Is it useful?

Not everything true, kind or positive is necessarily relevant. If the information doesn't serve a purpose - it may be better left unsaid.

## Usages

##### You notice some function in code is missing input validation.

- **Is it true?** Yes, inputs aren't checked.

- **Is it good?** Yes, adding validation prevents bugs and other issues.

- **Is it useful?** Yes, fix is actionable before deployment.

✅ Passes the filter.

##### You tell a coworker in the middle of a meeting: "That presentation was boring"

- **Is it true?** Maybe subjective opinion.

- **Is it good?** No, humiliating someone publicly is unkind.

- **Is it useful?** Not really, it doesn't help improve the presentation in that moment.

❌ Fails the filter.

## Summary

Applied from today, this simple filter can help reduce misinformation, prevent unnecessary conflicts and generally change how you communicate your thoughts.
